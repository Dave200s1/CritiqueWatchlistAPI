# tl;dr
A FastAPI-powered movie tracking system that lets you manage and rate films in your personal watchlist.

This FastAPI-powered Critique Watchlist API demonstrates a complete backend system for managing a personal movie collection, combining SQLite database persistence with RESTful endpoint design. It enables real-time CRUD operations on film entries with rating tracking (0-10 scale) and watch status management, showcasing practical integration of database operations with Pydantic model validation. While optimized for development environments, the production-ready architecture can be extended with authentication and scaled databases for deployment.
